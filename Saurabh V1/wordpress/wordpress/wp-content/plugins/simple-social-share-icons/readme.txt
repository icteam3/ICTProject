Places a simple, attractive social share bar at the bottom of posts. Social icons are retina-ready for high-resolution devices.

== Description ==

When activated, the Simple Social Share Icon places a simple social share bar below posts. Covered social networks include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+, plus an option to share by email.

The icons are served as a custom font, meaning that they won't suffer from image resizing or resolution problems as retina viewers grow more common.

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin. Check the bottom of posts; the share bar will appear. If you want to change color and/or size, the CSS for the social icons is easy to edit.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why use this plugin? =

If you want to "just drop in" a social share bar that works and looks nice.

= How does it work? =

It uses a custom icon font called [Entypo](http://entypo.com). This makes it look great on Hi-DPI or "retina" devices that might look fuzz if it used standard images.

= Are there any options? =

Not currently. Eventually we'd like to add more social network icons and allow you to choose a custom list, as well as give you styling options (size and color) for the icons even if you don't know CSS. In the meantime, if you'd like us to work on your specific implementation, [drop us a line](http://pressupinc.com/contact).
